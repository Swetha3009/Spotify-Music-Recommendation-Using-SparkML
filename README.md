# 🎵 Spotify Music Recommendation Using SparkML

This project implements a music recommendation system using Apache Spark's MLlib. Leveraging a dataset of Spotify tracks, we train and evaluate a collaborative filtering model to suggest music based on user preferences.

## 🔍 Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a scalable recommendation engine using **Spark MLlib's ALS (Alternating Least Squares)** algorithm. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generation of top-N recommendations for users.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains features like:

- Track ID
- Track Name
- Popularity
- Artist Name
- Genre
- User ID
- User Ratings (for simulation)

You can find the dataset under the `data/` folder.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark 3.x**
- **Spark MLlib (ALS algorithm)**
- **PySpark**
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
